# expensesTracker

Here is an expense tracker application. The graphical interface is written using java swing. There are three columns in the upper center of a window: expenses, incomes, total value. Each of type double, and has dollar currency. First two represent the respective values and the third is the difference between incomes and expenses. Below there is a table of all transactions represented with id, type(income/expense), description and date(format yyyy-mm-dd). Every transaction is stored in the database. I used mysql databases, and DataBaseConnection.java establishes a connection to the database which runs on my laptop. There are two buttons add transaction and remove transaction. The second one is obvious and just removes the selected transactions. When you press the first one, the corresponding window pops up, where you can choose type of transaction, description, set amount and choose dat(by default today). The date is chosen via Date picker pop up window. After you set all attributes of transaction, click add and the transaction will be added to the database and you will immediately see it in the table
